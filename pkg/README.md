Enemy Alert
===========

This mod will send you a notification whenever a new enemy is spawned outside
this ship.

Designed primarily to help with configuring enemy spawn curves to adjust
difficulty. You can use this together with the [Time
Flies](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/RATS_RND_division/timefiles/)
mod to be able to quickly run through an in-game day and see how many enemies
of which types have spawned.
